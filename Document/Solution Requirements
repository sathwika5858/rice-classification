3) Software Requirements

Programming Languages:

Python 3.7 or newer.

JavaScript (for front-end interactivity).


Frameworks & Libraries:

TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training CNN models.

OpenCV: For image preprocessing tasks.

Flask or Django: For back-end web server.

4) Functional Solution Requirements

âœ… The system must preprocess images by resizing, normalizing, and augmenting them before inference.
âœ… The trained model must accept images as input and return the predicted rice variety.
âœ… The web interface must support:

Uploading of rice images.

Displaying the predicted variety clearly to the user. âœ… The solution must handle unsupported file types gracefully, notifying the user.
âœ… The system must log predictions and errors for debugging and future improvements.

5) Non-Functional Solution Requirements

ðŸ”¹ Performance:

The web app must respond with predictions within 2â€“5 seconds.


ðŸ”¹ Accuracy:

The solution must achieve at least 90% classification accuracy on the test set.


ðŸ”¹ Scalability:

The app must support concurrent users without significant slowdowns.


ðŸ”¹ Maintainability:

Code should be modular, documented, and easy to update.


ðŸ”¹ Security:

Uploaded images must be handled securely and deleted after processing (unless logging is enabled with consent).

Secure communication protocols (HTTPS) must be used for online deployments.


ðŸ”¹ User Experience:

User interface must be simple, intuitive, and accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.

6) Dataset Requirements

A labeled dataset covering each rice variety the model needs to classify.

High-resolution images captured under various lighting and background conditions.

Balanced representation of all classes to prevent model bias.



---

7) Deployment Requirements

Environment variables/configuration files for different deployment environments (local, staging, production).

Cloud hosting setup (if deploying publicly), including:

Domain name (optional).

HTTPS certificate for secure connections.

Auto-scaling support (optional but recommended).
