📄 Requirement Analysis Document: Rice Classification Project

1️⃣ Problem Statement

Rice is one of the world’s most important food crops. Identifying rice varieties accurately is crucial for quality control, pricing, and ensuring authenticity. Manual classification is time-consuming and error-prone, highlighting the need for an automated image classification system.


---

2️⃣ Objectives

Develop an automated system to classify rice grains into different varieties based on images.

Create a web-based application for users to upload rice images and receive instant predictions.

Ensure the model generalizes well across different lighting conditions and camera qualities.



---

3️⃣ Functional Requirements

✅ Image Upload

Users must be able to upload images of rice grains through the web interface.


✅ Image Preprocessing

The system should preprocess images (resize, normalize, augment) before feeding them to the model.


✅ Model Inference

The system must use a trained deep learning model to predict the rice variety.


✅ Prediction Display

The predicted rice type should be displayed clearly to the user.


✅ Pages Required

Home: Introduction and navigation.

About: Details about rice classification and project motivation.

Predict: Upload and predict rice variety.

Contact: Provide communication channels like email, phone, and feedback.

4️⃣ Non-Functional Requirements

🔹 Performance

Prediction should return results within a few seconds of uploading an image.


🔹 Accuracy

Model should achieve a minimum classification accuracy of 90% on the test set.


🔹 Scalability

The system should support multiple concurrent users without significant latency.


🔹 Security

Uploaded images must be handled securely; personal data (if any) should remain confidential.


🔹 Portability

The application should be easily deployable across platforms (Windows, Linux) using Docker or similar tools.


🔹 Usability

The web interface must be intuitive, clean, and easy to navigate.

5️⃣ Stakeholders

Rice Farmers & Producers: Ensure accurate classification for quality grading and pricing.

Rice Traders & Distributors: Verify authenticity of rice varieties in supply chains.

Consumers: Confirm rice variety before purchase.

Research Institutions: Use system for varietal studies and data collection.



---

6️⃣ Constraints

Availability of a sufficiently large and labeled dataset of rice images.

Variability in rice appearance due to lighting, background, and image quality.

Computational resources for training deep learning models.



---

7️⃣ Assumptions

Users will upload clear, close-up images of rice grains.

Images will contain only one rice variety at a time.

The training dataset represents the rice varieties intended for classification.



---

8️⃣ Acceptance Criteria

Web application must allow seamless image uploads.

The system should predict and display the rice variety with at least 90% accuracy.

The user interface must work on desktop and mobile browsers.
