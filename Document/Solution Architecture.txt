Solution Architecture – Rice Classification Project

🎯 Overview

This solution is designed to classify rice grains into their respective types using a deep learning model. It provides a web interface where users can upload images of rice grains and get predictions instantly.

🔹 Components

1️⃣ Frontend (Client Interface)

Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Pages: Home, About, Predict, Contact.

Allows user to upload rice grain images for classification.

Displays predicted rice type on the Predict page.


2️⃣ Backend (Web Server)

Developed in Flask / FastAPI (Python).

Exposes REST endpoints for:

Uploading images.

Triggering predictions.


Connects frontend to the trained model.


3️⃣ Machine Learning Model

CNN-based classifier trained on rice images dataset.

Model saved in HDF5 (.h5) or SavedModel format.

Loads on server start; predicts on incoming image data.


4️⃣ Data Storage

Dataset stored locally or on a cloud bucket (e.g., AWS S3) during training.

Uploaded images can be stored temporarily on the server for prediction.


5️⃣ Logging & Monitoring

Server logs prediction requests and errors.

Optional: integrate tools like Prometheus/Grafana for monitoring usage.

🔹 Data Flow

1. User opens Predict page → uploads an image.


2. Frontend sends image to backend via HTTP POST request (/predict endpoint).


3. Backend receives image, preprocesses it to match model input shape.


4. Backend feeds preprocessed image to the ML model.


5. Model outputs rice type (e.g., Basmati, Jasmine, Arborio, etc.).


6. Backend sends prediction result back to frontend.


7. Frontend displays predicted rice type to the user.

🔹 Deployment Options

Local Deployment

Run Flask/FastAPI server locally.

Open web pages via localhost.


Cloud Deployment

Host app on platforms like Heroku, AWS EC2, GCP App Engine, or Azure App Service.


Containerization (Optional)

Use Docker to package the entire application.

Enables consistent deployments across environments.

🔹 Security Considerations

✅ Validate uploaded images (type & size).

✅ Limit maximum file upload size.

✅ Sanitize file names to avoid path traversal attacks.

✅ Use HTTPS in production for secure data transfer.

🔹 Technologies Used

Python (Flask/FastAPI)

TensorFlow / Keras / PyTorch

HTML, CSS, JavaScript

OpenCV (for image preprocessing)

GitHub Actions (optional, for CI/CD)
